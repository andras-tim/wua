0x80248002	WU_E_DS_INVALID	The data store is in an invalid state. This can occur if we attempt to   validate the database schema and find a mismatch between the current state and the state we expect.

0x80248008	WU_E_DS_MISSINGDATA	The data store is in an invalid state because data that should be present is missing. This error can occur if we encounter a column in a table that is NULL when it is not allowed to be NULL.
0x80248009	WU_E_DS_MISSINGREF	The data store is in an invalid state because data that should be present is missing. This will occur if we try to fetch a linked row from another table and the linked row does not exist.  This can happen with EULAs, files, and/or localized properties referenced by an update.

0x80248015	SUS_E_DS_SERVICEEXPIRED	the caller has requested a service whose registration has expired
0x80248016	WU_E_DS_DECLINENOTALLOWED	an update cannot be declined while it is deployed with a deadline by 1 or more services or if it is a mandatory update

0x8024801c	WU_E_DS_RESETREQUIRED	The datastore required a reset and either the state of the current session was too complex to retry (it is in a caller initiated transaction or a caller acquired a section lock) or the reset failed.  In either case, the only option is to release the session and try again with a newly acquired session.  Once a session returns this error, it will always return this error.
